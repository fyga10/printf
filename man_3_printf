.TH man - 3 - "09-11-2021" - "_printf"

.SH NAME.
_printf - Function that produces output according to a format.

.SH SYNOPSIS. 
.B #include "main.h"
    int _printf(const char *format, ...)

.SH DESCRIPTION.
.B _printf()
    The functions printf() write output to stdout the standard 
    output stream; write the output under the control of a
    format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or
    arguments accessed via the variable-length argument 
    facilities of  stdarg(3)) are converted for output.

.SH Format of the format string.
    The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in
    its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed
    of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which
    are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
    specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more
    subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is
    introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion
    specifier.  In between there may be (in this order) zero or more
    flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision and
    an optional length modifier.

.PP Conversion specifiers
    A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
    
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

.TP
.B d, i
    The argument is converted to decimal.

.TP.
.B c
    The argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting 
    character is written.

.TP
.B s
    the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an
    array of character type (pointer to a string).

.TP
.B b
    The argument is converted to binary.

.TP
.B o, u, x, X
    The argument is converted to unsigned octal (o),
    unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.

.TP
.B %
    '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete conversion 
    specification is '%%'.

.SH RETURN VALUE
    The function return the number of characters printed (excluding the 
    null byte used to end output to strings).

.SH BUGS
    No known bugs yet.
