.TH man - 3 - "09-11-2021" - "_printf"

SH NAME.
_printf - Function that produces output according to a format.

SH SYNOPSIS. 
.B #include "main.h"
    int _printf(const char *format, ...)

SH DESCRIPTION.
.B _printf()
    The functions printf() write output to stdout the standard 
    output stream; write the output under the control of a
    format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or
    arguments accessed via the variable-length argument 
    facilities of  stdarg(3)) are converted for output.

SH Format of the format string.
    The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in
    its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed
    of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which
    are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion
    specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more
    subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is
    introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion
    specifier.  In between there may be (in this order) zero or more
    flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision and
    an optional length modifier.
